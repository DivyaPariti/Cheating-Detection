# Cheating-Detection
Cheating and academic dishonesty has always been a disturbing practice in an academic setting, it kills the creativity of a student. Research shows that the rate of cheating is increasing day by day. The aim of this work is to automatically detect cheating through whispering of a cheater in the exam room. A new method has been proposed that automatically detects the cheating activity using temporal and spectral based features. The method is fully automatic and required no prior information about the input signal. The suggested method is suitable for visually disabled and deaf individuals who are employed in educational institutes but unable to perform the invigilator duties because of their disability. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB tool. The results obtained from the proposed method are very satisfactory and accurate. Moreover this paper also discussed the drawbacks and future work of proposed method in order to further improve the accuracy rate.
